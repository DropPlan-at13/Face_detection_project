Perfect 👍 Since your project is about **face detection + expression recognition** using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**, I’ll create a detailed `README.md` for you.
I’ll make it professional, well-structured, emoji-rich, and directly usable.

Here’s the full copy:

# 😎 Face Detection & Expression Recognition 🎭  

This project is a **real-time face detection and facial expression recognition system** built using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**.  
It detects a person’s **face landmarks**, draws an outline around the face, and classifies simple expressions like 😀 Happy, 😢 Sad, 😡 Angry, and 😲 Surprised — all in real-time from your webcam!  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- 🖼️ **Face Landmark Detection** using MediaPipe’s `FaceLandmarker` model.  
- 🎭 **Expression Recognition** based on facial blendshapes (Smile, Frown, Brow, Jaw, Eyes).  
- 🔵 **Face Polygon Drawing**: Highlights the face oval with a blue outline.  
- 💾 **Video Recording**: Saves the processed output as `output_video.mp4`.  
- ⚡ **Real-time Processing**: Smooth and efficient detection at ~30 FPS.  
- 🖥️ **Interactive Window**: Press **Q** anytime to quit the live feed.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.10+**  
- **OpenCV** (`opencv-contrib-python`)  
- **MediaPipe** (`mediapipe`)  
- **NumPy** (`numpy`)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup  

1. **Clone this repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DropPlan-at13/Face_detection_project.git
cd Face_detection_project
````

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python==4.11.0.86 mediapipe numpy
```

4. **Download the MediaPipe Face Landmarker Model**
   Download the model file [`face_landmarker.task`](https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/face_landmarker/face_landmarker/float16/1/face_landmarker.task)
   and place it inside your project folder.

## ▶️ Running the Project

Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

* The webcam will open.
* You’ll see a **blue outline** drawn around your face.
* Detected expressions (😀 Happy, 😢 Sad, 😡 Angry, 😲 Surprised, 😐 Neutral) will be displayed as text.
* Processed video is saved as `output_video.mp4`.
* Press **Q** to quit.

## 🧠 Expression Logic

Expressions are determined using **blendshape values** provided by MediaPipe:

| Expression   | Condition                                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 😀 Happy     | `mouthSmileLeft > 0.5` and `mouthSmileRight > 0.5` |
| 😢 Sad       | `mouthFrownLeft > 0.5`                             |
| 😡 Angry     | `browDownLeft > 0.5`                               |
| 😲 Surprised | `jawOpen > 0.5` and `eyeWideLeft > 0.5`            |
| 😐 Neutral   | None of the above conditions                       |

### 💡 Fun Idea:

Try recording yourself making different faces (Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised) — the system should pick them up in real-time! 🎥

Do you want me to also **add badges (like Python version, License, Stars, Forks, etc.)** at the top so your GitHub repo looks even more professional?
